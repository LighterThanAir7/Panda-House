# Panda House

Panda House was made as a college project where we had to create a restaurant-like website with user registration and ordering system. I chose to recreate [Restoran Panda's website](https://restoranpanda.hr/index.php) and work on top of it. The project leverages the power of modern web technologies to provide a seamless user experience, with various backend functionalities for robust performance.

## Figma

Feel free to check out some [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/VlTK2iNp6JQAoZ4nSr6YWY/Projekt-Panda?node-id=0-1&t=fh20dSC7nSC4DAwn-1) sketches and ideas before project was built. 

## Features
- Responsive, modern user experience
- Login & registration system
- Secure user authentication (using [JWT](https://jwt.io/) tokens)
- Dynamic menu showcasing available dishes
- Interactive cart and checkout process
- User reviews and ratings
  
The project follows a [REST API](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/RESTful-API) and [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) approach and uses a MySQL database managed through PHPMyAdmin to ensure scalable and maintainable code architecture.
